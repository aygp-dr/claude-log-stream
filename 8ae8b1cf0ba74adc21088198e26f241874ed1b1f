Context: User requested project configuration for Clojure development with tmux and Emacs integration.

Considerations:
- Added project-level environment variables (PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_ROOT)
- Created .envrc for direnv integration with project-specific environment
- Configured comprehensive Emacs setup for Clojure (CIDER, paredit, org-mode, TRAMP)
- Implemented tmux session management with automatic Emacs configuration loading
- Ensured the tmux session names are project-specific to avoid conflicts
- Added support for remote development via TRAMP

Implementation Details:
- Makefile targets: emacs-init, tmux-dev, tmux-stop
- Auto-generates project-specific Emacs config file
- Tmux session persists with detached Emacs for continuous development
- CIDER configured to auto-connect when opening Clojure files

Issues:
- None encountered during implementation

Timing:
- Implementation completed: $(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z')
- Changes tested locally and committed successfully
